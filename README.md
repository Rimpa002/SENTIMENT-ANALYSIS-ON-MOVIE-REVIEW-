# Problem Statement -
THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON MOVIE REVIEWS, WITH THE GOAL OF AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFYING REVIEWS AS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE BASED ON THE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED IN THE TEXT. THE PROJECT INVOLVES DATA COLLECTION FROM SOURCES SUCH AS IMDB OR ROTTEN TOMATOES, PREPROCESSING THE TEXT DATA BY REMOVING NOISE AND NORMALIZING TEXT, SELECTING AND TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS SUCH AS LOGISTIC REGRESSION OR SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, AND EVALUATING THEIR PERFORMANCE USING METRICS LIKE ACCURACY AND F1-SCORE. THE DEPLOYED MODEL WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO AUDIENCE SENTIMENT TOWARDS MOVIES. BENEFITING FILMMAKERS, STUDIOS, AND REVIEW WEBSITES BY INFORMING DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES AND UNDERSTANDING AUDIENCE PREFERENCES.

Data Collection: 
A dataset of movie reviews was gathered from platforms such as IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes.

Data Preprocessing: 
The text data underwent cleaning and preprocessing, including tokenization, removal of stop words, and lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Various techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings were employed to convert text data into numerical form suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Model Training: 
Several classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests, were trained and evaluated to identify the most effective model.
Evaluation: The model's performance was assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with confusion matrices and visualizations to understand the sentiment distribution in the dataset.

# Conclusion-
The sentiment analysis project demonstrated the capability of machine learning algorithms to accurately classify sentiments in movie reviews. The best-performing model achieved a high accuracy rate, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments. This automated approach not only saves time for users by providing a quick overview of movie opinions but also offers insights into trends and audience reactions. Future work could focus on enhancing the model by incorporating more sophisticated techniques, such as deep learning, and expanding the dataset to include a broader range of reviews from various platforms. Overall, this project serves as a foundational step towards developing intelligent systems for opinion analysis in the entertainment industry.
